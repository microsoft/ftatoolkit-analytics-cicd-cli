# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing. There are many ways to contribute:

- Submit issues to report bugs and make suggestions. Please search the existing  issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue and select the appropriate label from the available labels.

- Review the source code changes.
  
- Contribute features and fixes by forking the repository and creating a pull request.

- The naming convention for new features branches is _feature(fix)/issueNumber-description_. Example: _feature/13-doc-contribution_

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
